abstract: "Social segregation, the spatial and social separation between individuals from different backgrounds, can affect sustainable urban development and social cohesion. The literature has traditionally focused on residential segregation, examining how individuals' residential locations are distributed differently across neighborhoods based on income, ethnicity, and education. However, this approach overlooks the complexity of spatial segregation because daily activities often extend far beyond residential areas. Over the past one to two decades, emerging mobility data sources have enabled a new understanding of socio-spatial segregation by considering daily activities such as work, school, shopping, and leisure visits. From traditional surveys to GPS trajectories, diverse data sources reveal that day-to-day movements can impact segregation by reducing or amplifying segregation levels obtained when considering residential aspects alone. This literature review focuses on three critical questions: (a) to what extent do individual mobility patterns contribute to segregation? (b) Which factors explain the role played by mobility in segregation? and (c) What insights are gained by incorporating extensive mobility data into segregation research? Our literature review contributes to an improved understanding of socio-spatial segregation at the individual level and offers actionable insights into reducing segregation and addressing research gaps in the field."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study presents a literature review of how individual mobility interacts with socio-spatial segregation experiences based on empirical evidence.
