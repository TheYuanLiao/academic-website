abstract: "A cross-regional study of driving behaviour and technological preferences in typical driving scenarios, especially dangerous pre-crash scenarios, is presented as a contribution to the user experience design of in-vehicle driver assistance functions. Data from 46 participants are collected by one-to-one interviews following viewing of 11 video clips previously obtained from naturalistic field operational tests and representative of typical real driving scenarios. Six questions relating to each driving scenario are asked to reveal the differences between Chinese drivers and Swedish drivers. The results show similarities and differences in driving risk perceptions, decisions, and preferences concerning the assistance and specifics of potential advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) functions of drivers in China and Sweden. The preferences for assistance and ADAS functions are found to be correlated with relative driving risk perceptions and decisions in typical driving scenarios for both country groups. Based on the results, some suggestions for the design of driver–vehicle interactions for Chinese drivers are presented."
