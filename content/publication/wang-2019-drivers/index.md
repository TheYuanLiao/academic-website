abstract: "To date, many efforts have been made to explore how to support driver's decision-making process with advisory information. Previous studies mainly focus on a single modality, e.g. the visual, auditory or haptic modality. In contrast, this study compares data from two simulator studies with 50 participants in total, where the visual vs. the auditory modality was used to present the same type of advisory traffic information under the same driving scenarios. Hereby we compare the effect of these two modalities on drivers' responses and driving performance. Our findings indicate that modality influences the drivers' behaviour patterns significantly. Visual information helps drivers to drive more accurately and efficiently, whereas auditory information supports quicker responses. This suggests that there are potential benefits in applying both modalities in tandem, as they complement each other. Correspondingly, we present several design recommendations on Advisory Traffic Information Systems."
