Iâ€™m a visiting postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, Technical University of Denmark (2024-), affiliated with Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden (2021-). I work at the intersection of data science and human mobility. My research vision is the data-driven understanding of human mobility to empower the environmentally and socially sustainable transformation of global cities. The vision highlights using big and continuous data from newly emerged sources, such as mobile phones. My research focuses on understanding urban mobility patterns and social inequality through large-scale geolocation data, spatial analytics, and transport modeling.

I'm an active learner of data techniques especially data visualisation, scalable data science, and spatial analytics.
