The 11th International Conference on Computational Social Science took place in Norrköping, Sweden, July 21–24, 2025 ([website](https://www.ic2s2-2025.org/)). I'm deeply honored to have been part of the organizing team.

As a transport researcher, my path into computational social science has been full of eye-opening moments. In a world where disciplinary boundaries keep blurring, IC2S2 showcases how diverse communities come together to form a strong, inspiring "big family."

My work sits at the intersection of transport, mobility data science, and urban science. A project on socio-spatial segregation and human mobility has brought me into close collaboration with computational social scientists, physicists, and complex systems researchers. In day-to-day research, we're much closer than we think—transport scholars, computational social scientists, and others can work together smoothly and keep inspiring each other.

Special thanks to my colleague Josef Ginnerskov, who modeled topic themes from this year's submissions and produced a fantastic visualization. Large Language Models (LLMs) feature prominently, serving as a connective thread that bridges diverse themes.

One cluster that especially resonates with my interests is Mobility & Urban Life. I'll zoom in on that topic cloud and share a few insights from the accepted papers presented at the conference. You can also find a full list at the end of this article.

Relevant to my research focus on segregation, social mixing, and spatial inequality, there are a few studies about barriers, exposure, and who meets whom where, featuring the application of large amount of geolocation data. For example, Aiello et al. (2025) overlays highway networks with a massive Twitter follower graph across 50 U.S. metros to compute a Barrier Score, showing highways systematically suppress cross-neighborhood social ties—most strongly within ~5 km—and flagging corridors with long-lived segregation effects [118]. Rosen et al. apply Cuebiq mobility across 11 U.S. metro areas to measure how socioeconomic integration fluctuates over the day—across cities, within cities, and by POI type—showing places that look integrated at one time can be segregated at another [340]. Samaniego et al. build SES-tagged call networks from Chile and Brazil and, using a modified exposure index, find robust socioeconomic homophily, with main network components showing more cross-SES interaction than full networks [429]. Renninger analyzes visits to ~5 million POIs with counterfactuals to show downtowns drive more socioeconomic mixing than "bridge" amenities would predict—and that pandemic remote work cut such mixing by ~8% [561].

Across the other part of the collection, studies span disasters and resilience. For example, Naushirvanov et al. use mobile network data and alert timing to unpack evacuation and short-term displacement in the 2024 Valparaíso wildfires, revealing SES-linked differences in response [711]. In accessibility and transport policy, Cornacchia et al. introduce DiverCity to quantify route diversification and show how network topology and mobility attractors shape efficiency [418]. Climate and environment related work such as the one by Renninger measures how extreme heat suppresses mobility in Spain, with heterogeneous impacts by age and income [532]. Methods papers like the one by Bison et al. advances data quality and sensing, integrating UWB/Bluetooth wearables, smartphone diaries, and surveys to capture dynamic social contacts [266]. Fujimoto et al. advances AI for urban analysis by fusing a Vision Transformer with GPT-2 to generate realistic mobility trajectories from map context [386]. Migration research such as the one by Robiglio et al. applies network clustering to Austrian internal moves, surfacing administrative-boundary and urban–rural effects beyond gravity models [425]. Well-being studies like the one by Bergmann et al. link smartphone-tracked activity patterns to life satisfaction using interpretable ML across multiple countries [930].
