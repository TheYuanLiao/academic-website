This project explores the human-factor issues of designing advanced driver assistance systems: enhancing intelligence, comfort, and safety.

It covers the studies that I was involved in 2016 - 2017 at the [Division of Interaction Design](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/cse/organisation/id/Pages/default.aspx), Chalmers University of Technology.
