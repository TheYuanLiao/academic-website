This project uses empirical data, either from naturalistic driving or simulator experiments, to understand driver behaviours and apply the obtained knowledge to enhance driving safety, comfort, and intelligence.

It covers the studies that I was involved since the beginning of my master's study in 2014 - 2016 at the [iDLAB](http://www.idlab-tsinghua.com/thulab/labweb/index.html), Tsinghua University, as well as the followed efforts in 2016 - 2019 in the free time of my PhD study.
